Many people are affected due to gas leakage. To create an awareness among them, this system was proposed. In this system, we have used two analog sensors which works only in closed environment. In present situation there are many cases related to gas leakage which cause innocent people lives and property damage. Implementing this application can be useful for companies, houses, which can save lives of people. For identifying the leakage, we are using MQ6 LPG gas sensor. For measuring the weight, we are using Load cell. To intimate the leakage, we are using buzzer which will alarm when the limit is reached. If the cylinder is going to empty, the LED will glow. Hence, this paper presents a gas leakage alert system to detect the gas leakage and it also monitor the weight which will alarm the people onboard.
